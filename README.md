# MemeMe

Second project of [Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003). It's a 2-part app where this first one will allow users to create memes from images from device's camera or album and share them.

To acomplish that it was required:

- `UIImagePickerController` to get images from device's album.
- `AVCaptureDevice` to get images from device's camera (when available).
- Subscription to `NotificationCenter` to observe showing/hidden events from keyboard to avoid bottom label being overlaped by it. 
- `view.drawHierarchy()` and `CGImage.cropping()` to capture screen and crop meme area.
- `UIActivityViewController` to share or locally save the generated images.
